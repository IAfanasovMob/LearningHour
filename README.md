# LearningHour

What could be better than frontenders learning together? *Frontend outing*

What are we going to do? *learning together!*

- 5-10 minutes - intro to a topic
- 40-50 minutes - learn and practice. Some tiny tasks to asses the technologies world will be prepared and invented on the fly. We would sit together in one room and do those tasks. Asking questions and helping each other during the session is welcome.
- 5-15 minutes - share opinions/findings/thoughts about the topic with the team

Go to the issues section to vote for the next learning hour topics or propose the new topic. Once in a while we will pickup the topic and schedule a learning hour for that topic. Learning hour doesn't belong to any one - feel free to create topics and schedule learning hours yourself.
