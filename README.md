# LearningHour

What could be better than frontenders learning together? *Frontend outing*
What are we going to do? *learning together!*

5-10 minutes - intro to a topic
40-50 minutes - learn and practice. Some tiny tasks to asses the technologies world will be prepared and invented on the fly. We would sit together in one room and do those tasks. Asking questions and helping each other during the session is welcome.
5-15 minutes - share opinions/findings/thoughts about the topic with the team
